The [current jailbreak](http://pangu.io) for iOS 8.x from the [Pangu Team](http://twitter.com/PanguTeam) is mostly just for developers right now and is not recommended for the casual user unless you are prepared to deal with bugs and experimenting to get things up and running on your device.

* The current jailbreak does not include Cydia by default.    
* Your device may freeze while booting if you have a passcode enabled.    
* The quick photo access feature for sending photos in iMessage may not work.  (Fixed with [Pangu Untether 0.2](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/2kjmbi/update_to_cydia_substrate_095014_fixes_issues/))    
* Safari may stop loading web pages. (Fixed with [Pangu Untether 0.2](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/2kjmbi/update_to_cydia_substrate_095014_fixes_issues/))    
* Most tweaks aren't currently compatible.  (Check [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/ios8) for some compatible tweaks).

1. /r/jailbreak does not allow piracy tools, sources, or websites. No pirated tweaks, apps, etc. Why?    

2. Themes (and theme-related questions or news) should be posted in /r/iOSthemes.    

3. Use tags in your title (Tags allow readers to automatically hide posts using RES):    
 * **[Question]** - when asking questions.    
 * **[Request]** - when requesting a tweak be made. 

4. No misleading or sensationalized titles. Use detailed titles for both news and questions.    

5. Link to the source of news, such as the developer who made the announcement, instead of linking to blogspam.

6. No memes.    

7. No posts about removing passcodes from locked devices or bypassing Activation Lock.    

8. Giveaways cannot require more than comments for people to be eligible - no requiring likes/follows/etc.   
 
9. Do not make posts asking for people to donate money to you so you can purchase tweaks. If you're in need of free money, check out /r/beermoney.    

10. Be civil and friendly. No egregiously insulting/rude, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. comments or posts.
